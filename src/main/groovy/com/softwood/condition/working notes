world state is collection of strings and bools
where the bools are given by the sensors - world state is
name of [the sensor name, and bool value of the sensor]


preconditions - this sets the expected /required state of a sensor /and its value which if true
permits the action to be called


sensor watches something and returns true or false

each Action , has a list of preconditions that must be met for the action to be executable

Action has any number of  effects - which is the expected future sensor/value you expect to true after executing the action
if an action is run - stuff happens, and that stuff should change things, so sensor/value readings would be chnaged -
this sets the expectation on that outcome
